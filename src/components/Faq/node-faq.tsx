          Tickets are automatically redeemed. If you`ve set a custom aggregation threshold, tickets are aggregated accordingly before redemption; otherwise, it defaults to aggregating 100 tickets per channel.

          Please check the incoming channels page for the number of unredeemed tickets per channel.

          <b>IMPORTANT:</b> If the unredeemed ticket value per channel exceeds your custom aggregation threshold or the default aggregation value of 100, there may be an issue with your node. Please report this on the HOPR Telegram channel or Discord server.
